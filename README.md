[NOTE:-The Work is result of my Internship in crio lunch program of the Crio.Do company.]        

During the course of this QPrep Micro-Experience, We solved problems in a structured way by:      

    i. First articulating the problem statement clearly with examples.   

    ii. Brainstorming multiple approaches, understanding trade-offs and writing pseudocode for the chosen approach.    

    iii. Implementing the solution and testing it.    

The deliberate divide-and-conquer practice helps the developer to approach unknown problems with reasonable confidence.
